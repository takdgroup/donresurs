# Agent Instructions

## Self-annealing loop

Errors are learning opportunities. When something breaks:

1. Fix it
2. Update the tool
3. Test tool, make sure it works
4. Update directive to include new flow
5. System is now stronger

## File Organization

**Deliverables vs Intermediates:**
– **Deliverables:** Google Sheets, Google Slides, or other cloud-based outputs that the user can access
– **Intermediates:** Temporary files needed during processing

**Directory structure:**
– `.tmp/` – All intermediate files (dossiers, scraped data, temp exports). Never commit, always regenerated.
– `execution/` – Python scripts (the deterministic tools)
– `directives/` – SOPs in Markdown (the instruction set)
– `.env` – Environment variables and API keys
– `credentials.json`, `token.json` – Google OAuth credentials (required files, in `.gitignore`)
– `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

**Key principle:** Local files are only for processing. Deliverables live in cloud services (Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) where the user can access them. Everything in `.tmp/` can be deleted and regenerated.

## Summary

You sit between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (Python scripts). Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve the system.
